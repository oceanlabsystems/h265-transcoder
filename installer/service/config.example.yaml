# H265 Transcoder Service Configuration
# Copy this file to: %ProgramData%\H265 Transcoder\config.yaml
# and edit the paths below

# Required: Input directory to monitor for new video files
input: C:\Videos\Input

# Required: Output directory for processed files
output: C:\Videos\Output

# Encoder options:
#   auto    - Auto-detect best available encoder (recommended)
#   x265    - Software encoder (CPU, works everywhere, slower)
#   nvh265  - NVIDIA GPU encoder (fast, requires NVIDIA GPU)
#   qsvh265 - Intel Quick Sync (fast, requires Intel GPU)
#   vtenc   - Apple VideoToolbox (fast, macOS only)
encoder: auto

# Output format: mp4, mkv, mov
# Recommended: mkv (supports more codecs, better streaming)
format: mkv

# Chunk duration in minutes
# Videos longer than this will be split into multiple files
chunkDurationMinutes: 60

# Speed preset for x265 encoder (ignored for hardware encoders)
# Options: ultrafast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow
# Faster = larger files, slower = smaller files
speedPreset: medium

# Bitrate in kbps (optional, for bitrate-based encoding)
# Leave empty to use quality-based encoding instead
# bitrate: 8000

# Quality level 0-100 (optional, for constant quality encoding)
# Higher = better quality, larger files. Recommended: 70-85 for good quality
# For all hardware encoders (vtenc, nvh265, qsvh265), defaults to 75 if neither bitrate nor quality is specified
# quality: 75

# Enable watch mode - required for service operation
watch: true

# Optional: Move original files here after successful processing
# Uncomment to enable:
# processedDir: C:\Videos\Processed

# Optional: Move failed files here for manual review
# Uncomment to enable:
# failedDir: C:\Videos\Failed

# Number of files to process simultaneously
# Increase for faster processing if you have a powerful CPU/GPU
concurrency: 1

# Log level: debug, info, warn, error
logLevel: info
